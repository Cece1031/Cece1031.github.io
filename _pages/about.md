## About Me

I am **Qingni Wang**, a Master's student in Computer Science at the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, supervised by [prof. Bo Fu](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/info/1074/2136.htm). Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from **China University of Mining and Technology (CUMT)** (2019.09 - 2023.06). I also visited the **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTECH)** (2024.06 - 2024.10), where I was supervised by [prof. Feng Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PcmyXHMAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include:
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Conformal Prediction, Conformal Risk Control.
- **Hallucination in Question Answering (QA) Tasks of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).**

You can find my CV here: [Qingni's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/wqn.pdf).

# 💬 Research Experience
### A General Framework for Risk Control and Assessment in Multimodal LLMs (ICLR 2025)
- Developed **TRON**, a two-step risk management framework for VideoQA tasks in MLLMs.
- Proposed a **Sampling Step** (conformal score calibration) and an **Identification Step** (non-conformity score based on self-consistency theory).
- Achieved rigorous guarantees of marginal coverage and minimum sampling size in open-domain QA tasks.

### LongVALE: Vision-Audio-Language-Event Benchmark (CVPR 2025)
- Conducted comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on the **LongVALE benchmark dataset**.
