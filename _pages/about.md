## About Me

I am **Qingni Wang**, a Master's student in Computer Science at the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, supervised by [prof. Bo Fu](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/info/1074/2136.htm). Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from **China University of Mining and Technology (CUMT)** (2019.09 - 2023.06). I also visited the **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTECH)** (2024.06 - 2024.10), where I was supervised by [prof. Feng Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PcmyXHMAAAAJ&hl=en). I am currently a summer intern at the **University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)**(2025.06 - present), under the guidance of [prof. Xin Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io). My research interests include:
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Conformal Prediction, Conformal Risk Control.
- **Hallucination in Question Answering (QA) Tasks of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).**
- **Trustworthy AI Agents: Risk-Aware Planning and Reliable Task Execution.**

You can find my CV here: [Qingni's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/wqn_phd.pdf).
